                        <h1>Pa's Cycling History - an excerpt from the Coonabarabran Times in 2009 when Pa was 81</h1>

 

                        <h3><During a recent visit to Coonabarabran, Julien Plovie completed a 100 kilometre bike ride to the Sidings Springs Observatory. A special feat, considering Julien is 81 years of age.
                        
                         
                        
                        <br/><br/>Julien (Ingy's Dad and aka "Pa") was born in Brugge, Belgium, in 1927 and learned his cycling skills at an early age through sheer necessity. During the Second World War, Belgium was occupied by the Germans. Moving about the country was very restricted during this time and life was hard, with many necessities of life in short supply. To support the family, Julien, aged 13, would often cycle through the night with his Dad and two older brothers towards the French border to pick up supplies of tobacco. They would then sell it on their return to provide the family's main source of income.
                        
                         
                        
                        During these nightly forays, Julien would ride out in front of his Dad and brothers looking for German soldiers or Belgian collaborators. By the end of the war, they would be riding up to 40 kilometres at night to pick up 30 kilograms of tobacco each and then return the same distance, often being pursued or shot at by the German soldiers. Understandably, they learnt to ride very fast!
                        
                         
                        
                        When the war ended, bike racing became very popular within the local towns. Julien quickly adapted to competitive riding and in 1946 was crowned amateur champion of Belgium at the age of 19. After a very successful amateur career, Julien turned professional at age 21, winning many one day races and competing in some of the famous classics, such as Liege-Bastogne-Liege and the Tour of Flanders.
                        
                         
                        
                        Julien's strengths were in the shorter, one-day and up to five-day races, as already in the early 1950s performance enhancing drugs were starting to emerge. He couldn't compete in the longer stage races as the use of amphetamines was prevalent, helping to increase the heart rate of many in the peleton. Julien rode for a French based team at the time, and while he was given the drugs too, they simply made him sick and gave him side effects such as vomiting and diarrhoea. Instead, his secret formula for keeping him going on longer rides remained a healthy dose of rice tarts and strong coffee!
                        
                         
                        
                        Julien was married at the age of 24 and soon after retired from competitive cycling. Over the ensuing years, he has seen a number of his professional cycling colleagues die prematurely, many of whom used performance enhancing drugs during their careers.
                        
                         
                        
                        Julien still believes in the rice tarts and strong coffee and he has continued to ride actively at home in Belgium with his local club. Daily rides of anywhere between 50 and 130 kilometres have certainly kept him in fine shapeâ€¦although the climb to the Siding Springs Observatory was a little steeper than he's used to back home!</div>
